# Distance-metric-learning
This code implemented the learning algorithm from the paper "Distance metric learning, with application to clustering with side-information [Eric P. Xing]". Except from the original materials, there are some construction details inclueding more info to clarify the derivertion of formula in the paper and more experiment result from the metric.
