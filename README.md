# Distance-metric-learning
Implement the learning algorithm from the paper "Distance metric learning, with application to clustering with side-information [Eric P. Xing]".

*Detailed derivertion about some formulas in the paper.

*The objective function we want to achieve is as follows. (3-5)

min{A} sum{S}[(xi-xj)'A(xi-xj)]
